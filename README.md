# Sudoku
## Overview

My rendition of a sudoku game! It allows the user to play sudoku to their hearts content, with keyboard support for entering numbers and navigating the grid. It additionally supports a "point-and-click" approach by allowing the user to click in a cell with the mouse to navigate instead.

Other features include a pause menu, with a controls menu inside of it. This menu will gain more features as work on this project continues. I hope to allow this program to also feature different logical agent approaches to solving a sudoku grid with visualization as a means of helping users learn about the various approaches that can be taken by a logical agent to solve a problem.

## Development Environment

- VSCode on Windows 11
- Python 3.9.13

- Add 'notes' mode for note-taking in cells
- Option to save game progress, and resume upon relaunch of the program
- "Agents" menu, with selectable solving options to observe the visualization solving of a sudoku grid using the selected strategy
- Implement various solving agents using commonly known artificial intelligence (AI) methods
- Provide an indication of AI method selected, bind agent solution to Enter key
- Implement menu to change keybinds
- Implement scoring
